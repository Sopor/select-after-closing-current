# Select After Closing Current

[![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/v/select-after-closing-current.svg?style=flat-square)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/select-after-closing-current/) [![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/d/select-after-closing-current.svg?style=flat-square)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/select-after-closing-current/)

Configure which tab to select after closing the current tab: left tab, right tab or last accessed tab.

After closing a tab that is currently selected, Firefox usually moves the focus to the tab on the right. This extension can change this behavior and select the left tab, the right tab, or the last accessed tab instead.

After installing you can configure this extension by clicking Preferences of it in the Add-ons Manager. The buttons represent the order of preference: e.g. if "left tab" is at the top and "last accessed tab" is the second, after closing the current tab it will try to select the left tab, and then the last accessed tab (if there is no tab on the left). Click the up and down icons to modify the order.

The "opener tab" option uses an upcoming Firefox feature and doesn't work in the current Firefox version (2017-08-14). See [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1238314) for technical details.
